## üñ•Ô∏è Quickstart

A prebuilt **Windows executable** is available for download on the [Releases](https://github.com/StinsonEvolutions/CrossMuse/releases) page. Simply:

1. **Download** `CrossMuse.exe` from the latest release.
2. **Run** `CrossMuse.exe` (no installation required).

Note: The `.exe` version is self-contained but may trigger security warnings (since it's unsigned). If you prefer, you can run CrossMuse directly from source (see below). A background console window will appear when running the `.exe`; this can be minimized but must remain open.

## üì• Installation & Running Locally

1Ô∏è. **Clone the Repository**
```

git clone [https://github.com/StinsonEvolutions/CrossMuse.git](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/StinsonEvolutions/CrossMuse.git)
cd CrossMuse

```
2Ô∏è. **Install Dependencies**
```

pip install -r requirements.txt

```
3Ô∏è. **Run the Application**
```

python cm\_main.py

```

A console window will appear behind the main application window; this can be minimized if desired, but must remain open while the application is running.

## üì¶ Packaging as a Standalone App

For Windows users who prefer a single `.exe`, you can package CrossMuse with:
```

pyinstaller --onefile --collect-all ytmusicapi --add-data "Sample Playlists\*;Sample Playlists" --add-data "logo.png;." --name "CrossMuse" cm\_main.py

```
This creates a **self-contained executable** with no extra setup required. Note that the `--noconsole` option is intentionally omitted to provide a background console window for ffmpeg output.
